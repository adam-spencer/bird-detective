# bird-detective
Building an application from scratch to identify birds from their songs. Like Shazam but for birds!

## Plan
* Use a CNN to classify birdsong
* Training data from [xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org/)
* Develop a full ML pipeline - get training data, process, label, store, train model, evaluate
* Develop a nice UI, maybe start with a command-line thingy but aim to make something sexier
* Maybe take on some collaboration from others on the frontend - I'm not super confident about frontend dev
